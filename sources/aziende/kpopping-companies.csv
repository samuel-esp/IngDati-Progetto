Gold Label was founded in 2004 in Hong Kong, launched with the support of EMI, and acquired EMI Music Taiwan / EMI Music China (Typhoon Records) in 2008, reforming to Gold Typhoon. On 1 January 2011, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Global Management Asia (PGMA) under the leadership of Chairman Louis Pong. Gold Typhoon represents many Chinese and international artists, and has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Taipei and Hong Kong. In 2004, former Go East Entertainment CEO Paco Wong decided to not work with the parent company of Go East, Universal Group Hong Kong, but to instead work for EMI Hong Kong as they promised to launch a new label. Paco Wong was to have total control of the new label which became Gold Label Entertainment.
