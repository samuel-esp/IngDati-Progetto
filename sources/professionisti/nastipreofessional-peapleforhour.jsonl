I've always been a visual thinker drawn to the aesthetics of what's around me. It's a no brainer that I ended up doing graphic design although I have a background in traditional art, education and physics of all things. What gets me out of bed in the morning is solving design problems. Got a project? Let's work together. You can check out my portfolio to see the quality and attention to detail in my layout and design work. I particularly enjoy vector illustration and design work and have a clean hand drawn vector style. My print layout work was honed in my years working in the design and print industry producing print merchandise for the garment industry, advertising material as well as prospectus, catalogue and instructional leaflets. Underpinning my digital design skills is a wide range of artistic ability across a number of mediums. My portfolio demonstrates my skills in graphite, watercolour and pastels, with subjects ranging from portraits of people and pets to landscapes and buildings. My style is definitely more traditional rather than abstract, so you can tell what it's supposed to be! In fact if you can't tell who a portrait is then you can't really call yourself a portrait artist. I've been on PPH long enough now to have a super solid 5.0 average feedback with over 100 projects completed with a Top Cert rating, so let's work together on that next project of yours.

Hayland Freelance was established in May 2010 with a single focus: to provide the same quality of services and support to small businesses that are typically enjoyed by larger companies. The brainchild of Maria Haynes, a former office manager and Tracey England, an experienced graphic designer, Hayland Freelance is committed to the philosophy that every business deserves to receive exceptional support services, regardless of their size or financial status. We understand first-hand how difficult it can be, as a small business, to compete with the larger companies who have a bottomless budget and endless resources. But oftentimes, because the large corporations are focused on the bottom line, they lack one thing that the small business offers in abundance, and that's the personal touch; that interaction between provider and client that creates a bond of respect and loyalty. We, too, care very much about the bottom line, but we also understand that the first principle in business is building a solid, long-term relationship with your client where both parties have a thorough understanding and mutual respect for one another's business philosophies and goals. We believe these are key elements to any successful business relationship, and Hayland Freelance strives to develop just such a relationship with each and every client. As a result, when we partner with a new client, or take on a new project, we do not think of ourselves as outside contractors. Instead, we consider ourselves another member of the team, your team, who will work diligently with you until the task is completed to your total satisfaction. We blend old fashioned values with modern methods to deliver a service that is uniquely tailored to bring the visions you have for your company into a bold and impressive reality Job Title: Director Company: Wrap&Pack Solutions Description: Flyers and Presentation From:02/Aug/2011 To:05/Sep/2011 Job Title: Owner Company: Twiggerus Pug Breeders Description: Macro enable database of breeding lines and offspring.

I have been drawing and painting for as long as I can remember. At three years old i raised a paintbrush for the first time. My personal work has always been that of the surreal. In terms of commissioned work, it had usually taken the form of photo-realistic portraits, impressionistic live painting and various illustrative designs for book covers, tattoos, album covers and flyers. My work covers quite a vast area so get in touch! For the past twelve months, Kate has been in full time study, painting on a full time basis towards her MA Art Practise course, and has a number of exhibitions lined up for this year. Kate describes her art as surreal and an often amusing exploration of Reality; a new dimension with which the world can be seen. Her first step in the creation of her works is to quickly immortalise her ideas via the use of a mechanical pencil, after which she transfers the sketches onto panel and builds them through the medium of oil paint. Feel free to message me about my artworks at anytime, I always love a good chat about my working methods and techniques and process as well as the meaning behind each individual artwork. Thank you and much love to you all. \"With a great sense of intrigue gravitating towards the sub-conscious realm, Kate creates surreal works, reflective of her perception of Reality. Frequently referencing pop-culture and social issues of today, her narrative paintings fabricate a parallel universe where impossibilities prevail. Kate currently exhibits in Wales and London and accepts commissions worldwide.\"", "stats": {"projects_worked_on": "185", "buyers_worked_with": "149", "last_active": "Dec 15 2021", "response_time": "within two days"}}

Based in Manchester, UK I turned full-time freelance in Nov 2010 having gained a great deal of experience over a number of years designing for various corporations.

By the time I was eight I had started the habit of drawing caricatures of my teachers – a basic concept of self-preservation stopped me from sharing my efforts with them! There has always been a call for sketched characters to entertain or educate, to illustrate a point, for posters to advertise events or for individualised messages for greeting cards. Pencils, pens and paint form the base with digital/ graphics programs providing an extra route for alternative finishes depending on the desired effect. I have to admit I often feel that using computers for art is ‘cheating’, however with experience I have come to appreciate it as simply another technique with its own unique effects and advantages. My aim is to preserve the character, the charm and the personality of hand drawn art work and combine it with the efficiency and clarity offered by computerised programs while avoiding the mass produced look. Experiences through wildlife rehabilitation, animal welfare and riding have given me that ‘feel’ for how an animal moves and reacts. Being a dotty mother of inquisitive and energetic sons gave me ample opportunity to observe a hectic range of human movement (and the rationalisations) through the ages. That gives the ‘bones’ of each character.  All in all my learning has been a lifelong, hands on and observational experience. I want my sketches to retain an element of the life and movement that they portray. Each should be a personality, a character – and fun! I have enjoyed a variety of challenges and in being a conduit for people to express their individual ideas. Whether it has been murals on the side of a school wall, creating team logos, a stencil motif or screen designs and printing them onto shirts. Computer graphics tools have increasingly simplified the using of a mix of photos and design – be it for business or greeting cards, of a family’s pets to create a tribute for printing on shirts or bags or using a child’s photo and mixing it with a fantasy drawing to personalise a child’s school bag or shirt. Loads of fun! I have now reached a point where I can focus my energies on artwork and illustration and put to use the collective knowledge and experience I have gleaned to date – and always to keep learning more…", "stats": {"projects_worked_on": "23", "buyers_worked_with": "21", "last_active": "May 29 2021", "response_time": "within a day"}}

I can read and work with architectural floorplans, layouts, elevations and can turn them into artistic visualizations of any style: from photorealistic 3D animation to watercolour impressions. I have a solid knowledge and over 15 years experience with the 3D visualization workflow as well as traditional hand drawing/painting architecture. My top favourites are exterior architecture with nature, birds' eye view and maps, and all things historic, period style. Exhibition Stand: working for a stand building company for 8 years I've designed and visualized hundreds of stands that were built up on trade shows/exhibitions around the world, based on my visualizations. I've worked on all types of stands: compact and unique for small companies, huge corporate for big ones, representative for national agencies, shell scheme for budget solutions ect. I can propose designs using my industry experience and creative skills, can visualize ideas delivering photorealistic 3D renders, create dimensioned layouts and info graphics. Painting & Drawing: Concept art, backgrounds, illustrations, architecture, landscape and maps are what I work on mostly. I've been drawing ever since I can remember and it is my imagination, creativity, attention to detail and eagerness to observe and learn that makes me different. I use different techniques like hand drawing, digital painting, photo textures or 3D to deliver convincing, life-like artwork. I'm particularly great at picturing historic environments in an authentic way, creating map art and architecture - thanks to a great love and understanding towards these things. Animation: I worked on animated architectural visualizations, directed and animated a creative product visualization project and worked on my own artists' short film. I have the know-how, creative talents and enthusiasm to create beautiful animations both in 3D and the traditional way but have not yet gained much production experience. I'm looking for opportunities to work on short artistic animations and 3D visualizations for a start. About me: I quit working as an employee to become a freelancer in 2015 - one of the best decisions in my life! I enjoy learning of new projects, becoming a part and adding value to them. I'm an artist therefore I deliver best results with projects where artistic value and an impressive visual quality is a major requirement. I start by planning and finish by delivering high-end quality artwork - I'm not good at quick & sketchy type of jobs.

My name is Ruzzel, and I am a professional freelance illustrator/graphic designer. I know that there are things all clients looking for the types of services I offer are in critical need of: 1. Dependability. Clients look for someone who can do the job for them, do it well, and be there to provide support, advice, and opinions when needed. 2. Designer. Some people in our field are creative workers. That is, they take what is given to them or they make what are asked of them, nothing more. Most clients don't really know what they want until you show it to them, and there are not a lot of people who can read clients needs as well as I do. 3. Communicator. Communication is essential. I understand the need of clients to hunt for the guys with the best portfolios with the lowest prices. Unfortunately for the clients though, those nice portfolios, and the low bids doesn't come bundled with an easy communication line. They might find this fact before they hire, but almost always they learn this too late. Clients hope that communicating would not be as hard as they expect and they hire the low bidder. The time wasted because of miscommunication translates to wasted effort and money. In the end, clients almost always realize they paid for the low fee with the hassle and difficulty in communication. I am dependable, a designer, and a communicator. And you'll find that true when we work together on a project. With my 4 years worth of experience in this field, and with the number of businesses I have helped in creating their online presence and unique branding graphics, I assure you that you won't be disappointed with my services. I also offer 100% money back guarantee, no questions asked if you are a tiny bit unsatisfied with my work. If you feel that I can help you out on your project, just drop me a message and I'll get back to you right away. Thanks and I wish you all the best!

I have lived in Manchester for about 12 years, studying art and illustration and have spent the past 10 years living and working in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I now reside in Wrexham, North Wales again. Since I was a child, I have always been interested in Art and Illustration. I studied both at Wrexham college of art and in Manchester and Stockport over a period of five years. I had a few influences in becoming an illustrator, mainly a few friends like Jonathan Edwards and Neil Evans, childhood friends who are excellent Illustrators and people. Artists and illustrators such as Dave Mckean, Lane Smith and Mark Ryden are a source of great inspiration to me. I am quite diverse when it comes to art, from stylised creations to realism, although I mainly concentrate on the stylised form as I can express my own originality regarding illustration and put more of myself into my creations. My main field of illustration lies in the field of children’s books with a light feel and has a colourful flow to it, on the other hand, I do like artwork that is darker and more obscure such as the artwork of Mark Ryden and illustrators like him. I mainly use the traditional form of creating illustration, that is by hand, I love using acrylic paint or drawing techniques but have been exploring more in recent years digital art using programmes such as Photoshop, Illustrator and 3D Max Studio. I consider myself an Illustrator who likes to explore the realms of creativity. I have written books for children but never really finished anything as a whole. I have worked for a number of Editorials during past years such as Lip International and Fountainhead Studios who are based in Manchester and Stockport and Estrada who are based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I have had both Greetings Cards and Children’s books published with these Editorials. I have been a member of the Forum of illustrators in Argentina for many years and communicated with various fellow illustrators who have a beautiful range of diverse styles and character. Apart from Illustrating, I do have other hobbies or interests such as writing, music, songs or ideas for children’s books, playing guitar or piano, reading and things included in that nature. I have also worked from time to time as a teacher of illustration and for the past 10 years as an English teacher as a second language. If I wasn’t an Illustrator I would probably continue as an English teacher as I like teaching very much. Although the city life is where I have been living for the past 22 years or so and holds a great amount of potential and work possibilities, at heart I have always loved the country life where I was born and brought up. I like to listen to a diverse range of music but mainly avant-guarde or less well known artists such as Bill Callahan, Scott Walker and Peter Hammill. I rarely watch films but do like a particular genre such as some creative, imaginative or underground films such as Ingmar Bergman, Tim Burton, Kustarica and other creative and imaginative directors or producers. Area Covered: Illustration Work Experience Summary: I have worked as a freelance Illustrator for about 20 years with various places such as editorials both in England and Buenos Aires, Argentina. My specialist areas are greetings cards and children's books, in which I have had work published. Education Summary: I am principally skilled in the field of freelance illustration. I studied at Wrexham art college and Manchester and Stockport colleges of art for 5 years. I attained a HND in illustration and went on to work as a freelance illustrator for different editorials. I have worked also as a teacher of illustration and as an English teacher as a second language for 10 years in Argentina, where I also taught illustration techniques.", "stats": {"projects_worked_on": "20", "buyers_worked_with": "14", "last_active": "Jan 05 2022", "response_time": "within two days"}}

Designing prints for the high street, mainly girls- and teenswear. As well as designing, I was responsible for putting together range boards to be presented to the customers and drawing the garment shapes. The job also involved preparing the artwork for print, sizing the artwork onto patterns, create stud sheets and foil screens where needed and ensure all information was stated on the artwork before sent off to the factories. The job meant I had to cover a range of ages and style of working; from hand drawn illustrations for the youngest girls to more edgy design for teens wear.

I have always received 5 star feedback. You can find out more about me here http://usabilityaudits.co.uk/about-me/ WHAT IS A USABILITY TEST / AUDIT? A Usability test is a rigorous critique of your sites performance from the user perspective. It highlights areas of friction, such as poor navigation, areas of misunderstanding, areas of poor design and clarity etc, all of which contribute to confusion and difficulties for the user and thus contribute to increased bounce rates and lower conversion. Analytics are going to tell where your visitors are leaving your site and what your conversion rate is, user testing endeavours to tell you why its happening and how to combat it WHY DO I NEED IT? The importance of taking a test is multifaceted. It is all very well having the best looking website, but do you know what your users are thinking? Not only will it help reduce bounce rates, but it will improve the user experience, turning visitors into customers and thus improving your ROI. It will highlight areas of your site that could be deemed problematic from the users perspective. Furthermore it will act as a catalyst for improvement changes and inspiration for new ideas. https://twitter.com/UsabilityAudits https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCvkekFzy5g 07535334094 usabilityaudit@gmail.com usabilityaudits.co.uk", "stats": {"projects_worked_on": "233", "buyers_worked_with": "193", "last_active": "May 03 2021", "response_time": "within a day"}}

It’s part of my identity. I like it so much that even if I won the lottery tomorrow, I’d still draw every day. Yes, seriously! Here are the other top 5 most interesting tidbits about me. (short and sweet) 1. I find video games quite exciting and have worked in casual games with 3 different studios! I created 2D Art, caricatures, UI design, character design, photo manipulation, photo edition, and photomontages for Mystery Studio, Kef Sensei, and Batovi Games. (and obviously, I got to play them afterward!) 2. I’ve created photomontages, lifestyle shots, and photomanipulation for E-commerce companies selling everything from coat hangers, frames, and pet toys. One project that I really liked working on was in which I created black and white caricatures of 13 world leaders for bike seat cover in a bold, thick outline style. Imagine sitting on a bike seat cover with Trump’s pink lips under you. Pretty cool, eh? 3. Did I tell you about the Hidden Express video game? To start with, I was given a photoshoot of a specific scene like a bar or a library. I added diverse but relevant objects to the scene to create a feeling of clutter. To keep the scene consistent, I took care of the color, shape, lighting, perspective for a realistic feel and look. The end results? The client saved $$$ in booking locations, transporting people and objects, and production staff salaries! 4. Here are 3 things that supercharge me (in no particular order, but I am biased towards coffee any day) – being creative at work, a strong desire to learn new things, and my dear cup of coffee! 5. In short, here’s what I do for a living. I help people connect with brands. Save money for companies and help them get new customers. Build loyalty and trust with their ideal target audience using compelling images. Are you looking to build trust with your customers visually? Or get new customers? Drop me a message and I’d love to chat with you and know more about your exciting project! Ignacio ------- - SERVICE LIST - Just to make things easier for you, I attach a brief list of the most commonly requested tasks I provide to clients for both, 2D Art and Photo Edition - Manipulation projects.

My name is Pedro and I a web developer with 8+ years experience, 6 of them working as a freelancer. I have a passion for coding, making websites faster, more efficient and ultimately, I believe, that reflects on the quality of my work and the degree of positive results I achieve for my clients. All my work is done by myself and myself only. I never outsource work. I develop mainly PHP webites and web applications ranging from CMS's such as WordPress and PHP frameworks like Laravel. I am more of a backend developer but I am also strong on front end development. Javascript is also part of my skill set and in particular popular JS libraries like Reach JS. What you can expect from me? ✓ Determination and passion ✓ Focus on achieving the best solution that will lead to better results ✓ Commitment and on-time delivery ✓ No outsourcing ! ✓ A professional service throughout ✓ Proper communication and guidance What I will expect from you? ✓ Proper communication ✓ A photoshop wireframe ready for development. I am not a graphic designer! ✓ Focus on quality rather than deadline demands. - Web development projects present challenges that not always can be pre-empted. Excessive obsession for deadlines targets can, in most cases, compromise quality and that is an area that I am not willing to compromise so I am sure you are not neither. This does not mean it will take forever but rather that all aspects of the project will be properly analyzed throughout to make sure a well structured and efficient website is delivered with a main priority given to considering what solutions best fit your business so your business gets the best results. What services can I offer you? ✓ Custom website development(Front-end & Back-end) ✓ PSD to HTML ✓ PSD to WordPress ✓ Plugin development ✓ Custom PHP programming ✓ Website migration(all platforms) ✓ Website speed optimization ✓ CSS(styling) fixing ✓ Any WordPress related development ✓ Laravel development ✓ HTML5+CSS3 coding ++ IMPORTANT NOTE ++ - Please read on: One of the most important decisions you can make before you hire me, is to decide what technologies will be suitable for your business or type of website/application you want. This decision will most likely be the deciding factor and the difference between getting the results you are looking for or falling short. In many cases clients come to me having already purchased a theme and most of them have been chosen solely based on how it looks or what functionality is available. A lot of themes are inefficient and will make your website slow, unsecure and bug prone, so its always good to take in to consideration the requirements needed and seek professional advice. This not only will save you from wasting money on a poorly built theme but also potentially save you much more in terms of fixing bugs and issues that in many occasions will be noticed only after development as already started. ★★★★★ - Free Consultation provided. Just get in touch and I will get back to you within 24 hours. * * I will send you a complete report and plan of action for your website. Call me now and let's make great things happen!

Some of the tasks I perform for my clients are as follows: 1.\tI review my clients project and go over their project with them. We discuss their goals, publishing plans, trim size, cover ideas, illustration/graphic style choices, layout choices and the copyrights about their project. Then the parameters of the job’s laid out. 2.\tI then create a legal document that’s signed and delivered to my client for them to review.  I have them let me know what they want changed in the document. After the legal documents are finalized, we all get a copy. 3.\tThen I start creating the graphics in the style the client prefers, or I digitize the art they supply me with, or find royalty free images that fit their text. I share with them what I am doing and revise what they want revised. 4.\tAfter the graphics for their project have completely been approved by the client, I start copy editing the copy/story/text and send them a copy edited version of their text to review, change and go over. I supply backup information for my client to review, due to any copy editing choices that I made, that they are unsure about. When it comes to copy editing my client’s choices about the text of their publication is the final choice and I do not have an opinion about that, I agree with them. The clients always feel comfortable about their final grammar and editing choices. 5.\tAfter the copy/text of the project is completely approved, I ask the client to supply additional pages that go inside of their publication, like an author’s page, etc. I start laying out their publication and give my clients layout choices 85% of the time, so I layout pages in various styles for them to pick from. 6.\tThen I further consult with my client about the making of their publication covers, front and back. Plus make from 4 to 7 cover choices to pick from within what they envision.  And give them my expertise on what cover I think is best suited for their cover choice. I ask the clients to write copy for buyers to read about their publication, to place on the back cover and sometimes the front covers. Sometimes if needed I help copy edit the publication cover text. 7.\tThen I format the publication for print publishing, hard and paperback covers and for digital, ePublishing. 8.\tThen deliver the publication and their covers to the client. The client reviews their publication and covers formatted and I revise anything at this point that they see is needed. Now the publication is ready for publishing. 9.\t85% of the time I help my clients upload their publications onto their publishing platform that they picked. I go into their accounts and upload everything and fill everything out for them that I can. The client lets their publishing company know my name and email address and that I am going into their account to help them publish their publication. Then their publication is approved by their publisher. And the job is complete, but my clients return to ask me to work with them on another publication many times. 10.\tSome of the success stories clients have conveyed to me are: Several of the publications have reached a bestsellers list in their category. 2. Have had Barnes & Noble, inc. the bestseller’s bookstore  sell their publications in-house at their stores and on their shelves. 3. Barnes & Noble bookstore has requested that one of my self-published authors read their book and have a book signing inside of their Barnes and Noble store location. 4. Many of my clients have book signings, join and sell at book fairs and perform readings at various shops. They tell me that they sell out every book that they have on them to sell. 5. These publications sell in many types of store location, gift shops, drug stores, specialty stores, resort locations, hotel shops, cruise ship boutiques. 6.Some get their publication distributed throughout a school district, as educational books the teachers supply to the students at a certain grade level. 7. My clients earning increase and some receive 4,000.00 a month in earnings from sales. Some of the publications I work on are novels, self-help book, health books, science books, children’s picture books, poetry book, cookbooks, animal books, and more. My education list: 1.\tS.C.R.O.C., a trade school in Torrance, CA for Advertising Design, Illustration, Graphic Design and Cartooning. 2.\tLos Angeles Harbor College, I was invited into and accepted into their Honor’s Program, that required 17 units, a 4.0 GPA and an honor’s curriculum developed to parallel the general education requirements for most four-year colleges and universities, that is exclusive, higher-level classes that proceed at a faster pace and cover more material than regular classes. (I worked my way through the honor’s program as a full-time waitress at Tony’s Fish Market Restaurant on the Redondo Beach Pier). 3.\t Palos Verdes Art Center, for fine art classes. 4.\t El Camino College for watercolor painting, oil painting and theater classes. 5.\t Mira Costa high school graduate in 1990 and was in their advanced classes, (received straight A’s and perfect attendance my senior year of high school). 6.\t Alese Marshall’s Career School for interviewing skills/techniques and a fashion diploma.", "stats": {"projects_worked_on": "17", "buyers_worked_with": "12", "last_active": "Dec 24 2021", "response_time": "within a day"}}

An active and rewarding presence on relevant social media networks has aided my clients in growing their businesses and building relationships with their customers. Our experience in international marketing is extensive and our approach allows us the flexibility to work in ways tailored to clients and their business rather than relying on outdated approaches to marketing implementation.

My services expand over a broad range of print media services from branding, logo design, stationary, flyers, posters, typesetting and brochure and exhibition design. In my experience as a designer I have been highly client-facing and am therefore practiced in liaising with clients on a one-to-one basis, from initial brief through to final print stages - this has not only helped me understand client\\'s needs and how to meet them, but it has also enabled me grow into a confident, concise and well-spoken communicator. My experiences have also been extended into working as an in-house copywriter as I have a keen interest in activities which involve research and writing. Finally, my services include high-quality creative design work at competitive rates. I deliver a one-to-one service on all projects which I take on with utmost care and importance ensuring that all involved are happy with the service they receive. Having completed a 2-year MA course in Communication Design at Central Saint Martins School of Art and Design in July 2007, I spent this time (and my time thereafter) dedicated to the Information Design Pathway and found my passion for lateral, sideway and analytical thinking. I would describe myself as a visual thinker trapped in an analytical mind. My attributes and drive lie in the field of research and information handling for organisation and communication.
