What was the idea behind starting this organization? His story began with a visionary dream. A dream to build a process oriented company that follows ethical business practices where employees feel pride and customers get desired satisfaction every time. While I was serving as Project Management Head (I) observed various things, i.e. miscommunication between the customer and technical team. I also realized that the communication gap between employee and customer had severe consequences as the employee couldn't deliver the best outcome due to lack of understanding and eventually the customer was unsatisfied. So I envisioned to establish a process oriented the web and mobile app development agency powered by employee’s Head, Heart, and Hands to serve customers better. Pulling this off, however, was not a piece of cake because I belong to a middle-class Indian family and my dream to create the process oriented company was strained by a lot of hindrances, finance being the biggest of them. I rented a small apartment and inaugurated iQuinceSoft on 27th June 2012.

Since younger ages, I have always dreamed of creating a fashion brand which will be famous for its design and being worn by lots of people. My designs usually come from experimenting and draping, playing with asymmetry and dynamic shape at the same time. While studying in SCAD, I produced a body of high-quality works, exploring draping, weaving, dyeing, printing for textile research. I also produced 3D garments using CLO3D, Browzwear, Marvelous Designer, Houdini and Substance Painter. I also learned how to design my own website portfolio to promote my own works. My interests lie in science, technology and fashion. I am currently woking as lab intern in The Mills Fabrica, an incubator for techstyle startup (companies at the intersection of technology and lifestyle) and strategic partners. Before joining Fabrica, I also worked as an assistant designer intern in Aussco, a technology-lead knitting company focused on advanced technology and innovation. These two internships allowed me to expose to the latest fashion technology such as 3D printing and also virtual fashion design such as Browzwear.
