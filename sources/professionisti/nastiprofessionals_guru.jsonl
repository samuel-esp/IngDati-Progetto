A dream to build a process oriented company that follows ethical business practices where employees feel pride and customers get desired satisfaction every time. While I was serving as Project Management Head (I) observed various things, i.e. miscommunication between the customer and technical team. I also realized that the communication gap between employee and customer had severe consequences as the employee couldn't deliver the best outcome due to lack of understanding and eventually the customer was unsatisfied. So I envisioned to establish a process oriented the web and mobile app development agency powered by employee’s Head, Heart, and Hands to serve customers better. Pulling this off, however, was not a piece of cake because I belong to a middle-class Indian family and my dream to create the process oriented company was strained by a lot of hindrances, finance being the biggest of them.

My designs usually come from experimenting and draping, playing with asymmetry and dynamic shape at the same time. While studying in SCAD, I produced a body of high-quality works, exploring draping, weaving, dyeing, printing for textile research. I also produced 3D garments using CLO3D, Browzwear, Marvelous Designer, Houdini and Substance Painter. I also learned how to design my own website portfolio to promote my own works. My interests lie in science, technology and fashion. I am currently woking as lab intern in The Mills Fabrica, an incubator for techstyle startup (companies at the intersection of technology and lifestyle) and strategic partners. Before joining Fabrica, I also worked as an assistant designer intern in Aussco, a technology-lead knitting company focused on advanced technology and innovation.

I am an illustrator, animator and a graphic designer from Hyderabad. My skills and knowledge stem from an academic environment. I have a bachelor's degree is visual communication from the Faculty of Visual Arts in Podgorica (Mediterranean University). I have also had the pleasure of learning at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava (Slovakia) as a part of a student exchange program. These schools taught me the rules and mechanisms of giving stunning and communicative visual solutions to your ideas. Uncovering concepts, stories and imaginary worlds through illustration and character design has always been one of my greatest passions. That is clearly reflected in the skills I bring to bare in related projects. I have a firm grasp of the human anatomy, developed drawing skills, understanding of color and light. Raster and vector graphics are domains I work in. I also have a large amount of experience with animation and I am able to make designs that can easily be incorporated in a motion picture. Finally, as someone who has graphic design education I have no problem with combining illustrative and typographic elements in order to create various promotional materials, posters, billboards, visual identities and similar design solutions.

I used to attend art classes for 7 years. Then after I graduated in Nursing, I decided to do  Professional Diploma in Graphic Design. Throughout this course, I had the opportunity to work on several designs including logo, flyers, brochures and much more. During these briefs, I continued to improve my team work and communication skills whilst continuing to develop my organisation skills and self-motivation by working on self innovated projects.By working on a range of projects this had helped me gain a deeper understanding on the subject specifically on each aspect that is needed for graphic design. This has given me skills needed in the world of work including in depth knowledge in areas such as typography, branding and digital design and layout adjustment.Taking my skills further and having done lots of training in software such as Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop, I have improved the quality of my work and my software skills.

I know how to work through the product development process and tight timelines with internal teams and overseas vendors, including creating artwork packages with print repeats and design sheets with product details, all in Adobe Illustrator. I spent over 5 years working on the licensing team, creating designs collaborating with companies like Disney, Star Wars, and Peanuts to create apparel, accessories, and home products. I also designed and recolored prints and graphics for the main Hanna line, outlet, and wholesale customers. Most recently I have taken on freelance work that has included graphic, print, embroidery, and apparel design. I love working on a wide range of products. I enjoy taking the parameters set by the client and specific project and playing within those lines and delivering what's needed on time.

Not just drawing or painting, but sculpting with clay or plaster, and playing with pretty much any medium. I was never a conformist, either.

I suppose you could say that was my first step into the realm of \"thinking outside the box\". Years later, I like to think I'm less of a brat now. Well, maybe I am, but with good humour! I'm also still in the art world. I worked with horses for a while, but I suppose it was inevitable that I eventually turned back to the arts again...in the form of Graphic Design. And there I've been since 1995, when I graduated from Sheridan College, Oakville, Ontario. I love nothing better than to sink into solving the puzzle of coming up with a new design. Making something pretty is one thing, but is it effective? Is the look and feel right for the message? For the company image? For the target audience? Whether it's for print or for the web, I can provide a simple design, or no-holds-barred \"WOW\" art. Whatever is appropriate is what I shoot for. I use the usual Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign, along with a bunch of other programs, too. My latest passion has been book cover design - how great to combine a love of reading and visual art!! I have a very patient husband, a mischievous son, and a clingy cat, and we live in beautiful Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. We love music, playing in the park, horses (well, my son and I do, anyway), hanging with friends, fixing up the house...oh, and FOOD!!!! I really need to lay off the food...

So during my job as a content manager(I got a promotion), I started learning WordPress. I learned designing, HTML, CSS, JS, and basic PHP. I invested in tools and plugins. As I was learning someone asked me she needs a website but doesn't have a budget for it. I said: 'I can do it'. Although that website wasn't ever published, but I did complete that project and she really appreciated it. And that's when I got hooked into Website Designing and Development. Since then I have developed several excellent projects. Check out my profile. I have quit my job. Me and my brother who is a PHP developer started a small website agency. Every day I wake up and the first thing I do is to keep learning the coding(currently I'm mastering JavaScript) and in the evenings I make websites to keep paying our bills. This is me and my story.
